# Data Driven Testing
- Data Driven Testing: Control test execution of test cases with `Testing Data`
- Automation Testing framework with Data-Driven. Test framework works with Data Sources:
  (CSV, JSON, YML, DATABASE, ...).
- Keep Test script in Framework separate with testing data, 
instead of inputting test data into test scripts directly. 

# Data Types - Data-Driven
- Static Data (Locators, Credentials, ...)
- Dynamic Data: Using script to generate test data
